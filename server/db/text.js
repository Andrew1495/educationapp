// Coral reefs provide an important ecosystem for life underwater, 
// protect coastal areas by reducing the power of waves hitting the coast,
// and provide a crucial source of income for millions of people.

// Coral reefs teem with diverse life. Thousands of species can be found living on one reef. 
// The Great Barrier Reef contains over 400 coral species, 1,500 fish species, 4,000 mollusc species and six of the world's 
// seven sea turtle species. The Coral Triangle - a coral-rich marine region in Southeast Asia that encompasses the waters 
// between Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Papua New Guinea - is the most biologically diverse marine ecosystem on 
// Earth.
